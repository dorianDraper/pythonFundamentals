What is Matplotlib?

Matplotlib was created by John D. Hunter. Matplotlib is open source and we can use it freely.
Matplotlib is mostly written in python, a few segments are written in C, Objective-C and Javascript 
for Platform compatibility.
Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and 
interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and 
IPython shell, web application servers, and various graphical user interface toolkits.

Matplotlib Get Started

If you have Python and PIP already installed on a system, then installation of Matplotlib is very easy.
Install it using this command:
C:\Users\Your Name>pip install matplotlib

If this command fails, then use a python distribution that already has Matplotlib installed,  
like Anaconda, Spyder etc.

Import Matplotlib

Once Matplotlib is installed, import it in your applications by adding the import module statement:
import matplotlib
Now Matplotlib is imported and ready to use:

Checking Matplotlib Version

The version string is stored under __version__ attribute.
Example
import matplotlib
print(matplotlib.__version__)

Note: two underscore characters are used in __version__.
