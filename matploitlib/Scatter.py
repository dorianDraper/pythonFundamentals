Matplotlib Scatter

With Pyplot, you can use the < scatter() > function to draw a scatter plot.

The scatter() function plots one dot for each observation. It needs two arrays 
of the same length, one for the values of the x-axis, and one for values on the y-axis:
Example: A simple scatter plot:
"""
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import numpy as np 

x = np.array([5, 7, 8, 7, 2, 17, 2, 9, 4, 11, 12, 9, 6])
y = np.array([99, 86, 87, 88, 111, 86, 103, 87, 94, 78, 77, 85, 86])

plt.scatter(x,y)
plt.show()
"""
The observation in the example above is the result of 13 cars passing by.
The X-axis shows how old the car is.
The Y-axis shows the speed of the car when it passes.

Are there any relationships between the observations?
It seems that the newer the car, the faster it drives, 
but that could be a coincidence, after all we only registered 13 cars.
"""
"""
Compare Plots

In the example above, there seems to be a relationship between speed and age, but what if 
we plot the observations from another day as well? Will the scatter plot tell us something else?
Example: Draw two plots on the same figure:
"""
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import numpy as np 

#day one, the age and speed of 13 cars:
x1 = np.array([5, 7, 8, 7, 2, 17, 2, 9, 4, 11, 12, 9, 6])
y1 = np.array([99, 86, 87, 88, 111, 86, 103, 87, 94, 78, 77, 85, 86])
plt.scatter(x1,y1)

#day two, the age and speed of 15 cars:
x2 = np.array([2,2, 8,1, 15,8,12,9,7,3,11,4,7,14,12])
y2 = np.array([100,105,84,105,90,99,90,95,94,100,79,112,91,80,85])
plt.scatter(x2,y2)

plt.show()
"""
Note: The two plots are plotted with two different colors, by default blue and orange, you will 
learn how to change colors later in this chapter.

By comparing the two plots, I think it is safe to say that they both gives us the same conclusion: 
the newer the car, the faster it drives.
"""
"""
Colors

You can set your own color for each scatter plot with the color or the c argument:
Example: Set your own color of the markers:
"""
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import numpy as np 

#day one, the age and speed of 13 cars:
x1 = np.array([5, 7, 8, 7, 2, 17, 2, 9, 4, 11, 12, 9, 6])
y1 = np.array([99, 86, 87, 88, 111, 86, 103, 87, 94, 78, 77, 85, 86])
plt.scatter(x1,y1, color = 'hotpink')

#day two, the age and speed of 15 cars:
x2 = np.array([2,2, 8,1, 15,8,12,9,7,3,11,4,7,14,12])
y2 = np.array([100,105,84,105,90,99,90,95,94,100,79,112,91,80,85])
plt.scatter(x2,y2, c = '#88c999')

plt.show()
"""
Color Each Dot

You can even set a specific color for each dot by using 
an array of colors as value for the < c > argument:

Note: You cannot use the color argument for this, only the c argument.
Example: Set your own color of the markers:
"""
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np 

x = np.array([5, 7, 8, 7, 2, 17, 2, 9, 4, 11, 12, 9, 6])
y = np.array([99, 86, 87, 88, 111, 86, 103, 87, 94, 78, 77, 85, 86])
colors = np.array(["red","green","blue","yellow","pink","black","orange","purple","beige","brown","gray","cyan","magenta"])

plt.scatter(x, y, c = colors)
plt.show()
"""
ColorMap

The Matplotlib module has a number of available colormaps.
A colormap is like a list of colors, where each color has a value that ranges from 0 to 100.
Here is an example of a colormap:
This colormap is called 'viridis' and as you can see it ranges from 0, which is a purple color, 
and up to 100, which is a yellow color.

How to Use the ColorMap

You can specify the colormap with the keyword argument < cmap > with the value of the colormap, 
in this case 'viridis' which is one of the built-in colormaps available in Matplotlib.

In addition you have to create an array with values (from 0 to 100), one value for each of 
the point in the scatter plot:
Example: Create a color array, and specify a colormap in the scatter plot:
"""
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np 

x = np.array([5, 7, 8, 7, 2, 17, 2, 9, 4, 11, 12, 9, 6])
y = np.array([99, 86, 87, 88, 111, 86, 103, 87, 94, 78, 77, 85, 86])
colors = np.array([0,10,20,30,40,45,50,55,60,70,80,90,100])

plt.scatter(x, y, c = colors, cmap = 'viridis')
plt.colorbar()	#include the colormap in the drawing by including the plt.colorbar() statement
plt.show()
"""

"""
Size

You can change the size of the dots with the < s > argument.
Just like colors, make sure the array for sizes has the same length as the arrays 
for the x- and y-axis:
Example: Set your own size for the markers:
"""
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.array([5, 7, 8, 7, 2, 17, 2, 9, 4, 11, 12, 9, 6])

sizes = np.array([20,50,100,200,500,1000,60,90,10,300,600,800,75])

plt.scatter(x, y, s = sizes)
plt.show()
"""
Alpha

You can adjust the transparency of the dots with the alpha argument.
Just like colors, make sure the array for sizes has the same length 
as the arrays for the x- and y-axis:
Example: Set your own size for the markers:
"""
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.array([5, 7, 8, 7, 2, 17, 2, 9, 4, 11, 12, 9, 6])
y = np.array([99, 86, 87, 88, 111, 86, 103, 87, 94, 78, 77, 85, 86])
sizes = np.array([20,50,100,200,500,1000,60,90,10,300,600,800,75])

plt.scatter(x, y, s = sizes, alpha = 0.5)
plt.show()
"""
Combine Color Size and Alpha

You can combine a colormap with different sizes on the dots. 
This is best visualized if the dots are transparent:
Example: Create random arrays with 100 values for x-points, y-points, colors and sizes:
"""
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.random.randint(100, size=(100))
y = np.random.randint(100, size=(100))
colors = np.random.randint(100, size=(100))
sizes = 10 * np.random.randint(100, size=(100))

plt.scatter(x, y, c=colors, s=sizes, alpha=0.5, cmap='nipy_spectral')
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()
